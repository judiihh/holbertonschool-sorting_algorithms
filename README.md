# Sorting Algorithms Project

## Overview
This project, collaboratively completed by Diego DÃ­az and Judith Espinal, focuses on implementing and analyzing various sorting algorithms. It emphasizes understanding their time complexities, stability, and performance characteristics. The work demonstrates the core concepts of algorithm design, optimization, and Big O notation evaluation. The project adheres to Holberton's coding standards and aims to deepen our understanding of sorting algorithms.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, we achieved the following:
* Mastery of at least four sorting algorithms:
    * Bubble Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Quick Sort
* Evaluation of algorithms using Big O notation in best, average, and worst-case scenarios.
* Understanding and identifying stable sorting algorithms.
* Choosing the most efficient sorting algorithm based on input characteristics.
